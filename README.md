## The Game

This beloved two player game has many different names and can be found being played in countries all over the world. Originaly played as a house hold board game, it can now be found on platforms of all kinds. The object of the game is simple, get four of the same colors in a row and win! Players alternate turn placing one of two color chips or pieces in a specific slot on the board and the first one to achieve four of their color in a row is the winner of the game. This is a game for all ages.

## The Rules

The rules of the game are short and simple. Only once chip/ piece may be place on the board at a time. The chip must be placed on a chip slot. Players must used one of the two colors provided. Once the color has been chosen, each player may only use that specific color. Only one turn at a time for each player and players must alternate turns. The game continues until every slot on the board is taken or until one players color matches up to 4 in a row, at which point the game ends and then players can reset and play again. The winning combinations of 4 colors in a row can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.
